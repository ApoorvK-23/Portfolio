    blurb:
      "A Streamlit app that ingests multiple CSV/Excel files or connects directly to Shopify. It standardizes schemas, cleans data, unifies tables, and powers dashboards with KPIs, forecasts, and stockout risk analysis.",
    tags: [

    content: {
      overview:
        "Built a Streamlit app to unify messy retail data sources. Users can upload multiple CSV/Excel files with varying schemas, or connect directly to Shopify orders via API. The app maps columns to a canonical schema, cleans/normalizes data, and produces unified datasets.",
      problem:
        "Retailers often struggle with fragmented reporting across spreadsheets and e-commerce platforms, wasting time reconciling formats before analysis.",
      approach:
        "Implemented per-sheet schema mapping with synonym detection, union with provenance (`source_file`, `source_sheet`, `Source_Origin`), and optional pre-aggregation recipes. Added forecasting using weekday averages, anomaly detection via z-scores, and a stockout risk table. The UI uses KPI cards, interactive dashboards, and an optional GPT-powered analyst for insights.",
      outcome:
        "The app reduces data preparation overhead, lets teams quickly explore KPIs across multiple sources, and provides actionable risk forecasts. Shopify integration validates schema via GraphQL introspection and enables direct ingestion of live order data.",

        "Traditional inventory policies often led to excess holding costs or frequent stockouts, with no simple way to simulate trade-offs in Excel.",
      approach:
        "Implemented a genetic algorithm within Excel using VBA and Solver to simulate multiple generations of possible inventory policies. Added flexibility for inputting demand forecasts, costs, and constraints, with automated scenario testing.",
      outcome:
        "The model reduced expected stockouts by ~20% while lowering holding costs, giving decision-makers a practical tool for inventory planning. It also demonstrated how optimization techniques can be applied directly in Excel without specialized software.",
